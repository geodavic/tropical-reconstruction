# Solving the reconstruction problem for tropical neural networks

This is a repository implementing the algorithms presented in "Tropical and Convex Geometry of Depth Two ReLU Neural Networks." We assume the user is familiar with the concepts and notation therein.

# Examples

Here are some example uses of the code that demonstrate capability.

## Tropical Polynomials

```python
>>> from function import TropicalPolynomial
```


## Polynomial Neural Networks
